Description: An R interface to the SWISS-MODEL protein structure homology modeling service that provides programmatic access to automated protein structure prediction. This package enables users to predict protein structures from amino acid sequences using the Swiss-Model web service directly within R, while offering basic analysis and visualization capabilities through seamless integration with the 'bio3d' and 'r3dmol' R packages.
